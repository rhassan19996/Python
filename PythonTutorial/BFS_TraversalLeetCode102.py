# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
# (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
# For BFS Breadth first search use Queue to implement the array
